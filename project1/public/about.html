  - the links do not have to go to valid page

Visual requirements of the rendered header:
- the logo is presented to the left of the h1 text
- You may modify the size and appearance of the h1 element as long as it visually remains a heading
- the nav menu is horizontal links spanning the width of the header
  - At the adaptive breakpoint the menu converts to vertical list
- the nav links are not required to follow the 12 column grid, but that is permitted -->
